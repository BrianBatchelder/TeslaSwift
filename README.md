# TeslaSwift
Swift library to access the Tesla Model S API

Installation
============

####Manual

Copy `Sources` folder into your project

####CocoaPods
```ruby
	pod 'TeslaSwift'
```
####Swift Package Manager
You can use [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) and specify a dependency in `Package.swift` by adding this:
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/jonasman/TeslaSwift.git", majorVersion: 1)
```

Note: The dependencies are not yet SPM ready!

Usage
============
Import the module
```swift
	import TeslaSwift
```

1. Perform an authentication with your My Tesla credentials: `TeslaSwift.defaultInstance.authenticate(email, password: password)`
2. Use the future to check the success: 
```swift 
.andThen { (result) -> Void in
					
					switch result {
					case .Success(_):
						//LogedIn!
					case .Failure(let error):
						print("Error: \(error as NSError)")
					}
					
				}
```


Example
===========
```swift

class ViewController {

  func showCars() {

    TeslaSwift.defaultInstance.getVehicles().andThen { 
      (results) -> Void in
			
			switch results {
			case .Success(let response):
				self.data = response
				self.tableView.reloadData()
			case .Failure(_): break
			}
			
		}
	
  }
}
```    

Options
============
You can use the mock server by setting: `TeslaSwift.defaultInstance.useMockServer = true`

Other Features
============
After the authentication is done. The library manages itself the access token. 
When the token expires the library will perform another authentication with your past credentials.
